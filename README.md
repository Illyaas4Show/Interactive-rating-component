## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This is my first ever JavaScript project and I am pretty happy with it. JavaScript is quite fun. I learnt some basic things about js like:

```js
element.style.background = ('red'); // To style things
document.querySelectorAll('element'); // And how selectors work

// If statements
if (condition) {
  output
} else {
  other output
}

// Also used arrow functions which I love!
let function = (param) => {
  function
}

```

### Continued development

I would really like to improve my javascript skills as it is very useful.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I always use this site to check on things. It is the most useful site I have ever used for coding!
